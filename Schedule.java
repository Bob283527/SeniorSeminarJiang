		/*should i use the organized data from my ranker.java
		 * to place the students who submitted first until each course in the first session is filled up
		 * if the course is filed but the student put it as their first chocie then we look towards their second choice
		 * we keep going through their choices until  one of the courses have a free spot
		 * if all 5 of their choices are filled then put them into the course with the least amt of people
		 * we put the students that got their first chocie into a temp var and out them at the bottom of the array 
		 * then for second sessiosn we start where we left off so now the students who didnt get their first chocie has a chance to get it now
		 * and those who got their first chocie will either get their second or third or fourth or fifth
		 * whenever a student gets one of their 5 choices replace the choice used with a 0
		 * so now when we start placing students inbto the second session we know to not use the choice that has a 0 
		 * keep repeating until all 5 sessions and their courses are filled
		 * 
		 * do a course popularity ranker to know whch courses should get a second session
		 * look at the numbers in choice 1 those are worth 5 points tpwards the course counter
		 * choice 2 is 4 points, choice 3 is 3 points etc...
		 * the most popular courses get a second time to run
		 * 
		 * so any student that did not get their number one choice in the popular course has a chance to get it now based on time
		 * 
		 * theres also 2 slots for each course
